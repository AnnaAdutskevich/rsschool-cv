About Myself:
After finishing education in medical college worked as Paramedic-obstetrician. Then after 2 years of working there desided to change sphere to Frontend-development. 

I started learning Frontend basics by myself. 

After two years of working in medicine, I realised that I was not able to fully express myself and my knowledge in this field.  So I decided to change my career to one where knowledge is valued and there is an opportunity to prove myself. 
I spent a few months to find something I liked. 
I started to study html and css, started to write my first pages, which I drew myself in figma. That's what I liked right away. When I learned the basics of html and css, I began to learn my first programming language - JavaScript. That's when I realised that this is what I like to do.
Looking for my first company for an internship or junior frontend-developer position. In my spare time I go to the gym, play Battleship, and read books. I consider knitting and making confectionery to be my hobbies
